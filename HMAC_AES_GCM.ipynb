        "I'll create a Python script implementing the AES block cipher in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). AES-GCM is a widely used encryption mode because it provides both confidentiality and integrity, making it suitable for secure communication.

        "This Python script uses the AES block cipher in GCM mode to encrypt and decrypt an English text string. AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode, meaning it ensures both data confidentiality and integrity. The script will demonstrate both encryption and decryption of a sample text. It uses the PyCryptodome library, which simplifies AES-GCM implementation and management of cryptographic keys and nonces.\n",
